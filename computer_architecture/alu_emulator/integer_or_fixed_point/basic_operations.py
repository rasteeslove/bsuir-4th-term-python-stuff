"""
Summary:
This module contains methods implementing basic operations for working with 
binary strings of some fixed bit size* like ALU does.

The methods are:
- sum
- invert_bits
- neg
- translate
- shift_left
- logical_shift_right
- arithmetic_shift_right

Remarks:
* the bit size is not exactly fixed but the framework is provided to work
with the binary strings keeping their length constant to emulate 
the registers.

The whole system is flexible though and can be configured 
to avoid any overflows.
